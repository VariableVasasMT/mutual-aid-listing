You're now ready to go. If you want to customize the Airtable base, please refer to [`gatsby-source-airtable` plugin documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-airtable/).

### Data update

The data from Airtable **does not** update automatically, even when you're running the `develop` process.

If you modified any data in your Airtable base, please be sure to restart the development process, so the new data can be downloaded.
